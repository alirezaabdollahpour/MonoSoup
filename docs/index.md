# MonoSoup Research Blog

This blog is the technical companion to the MonoSoup repository. It explains the method and implementation choices in:

- [`MonoSoup.py`](https://github.com/alirezaabdollahpour/MonoSoup/blob/main/MonoSoup.py)
- [`CKA.py`](https://github.com/alirezaabdollahpour/MonoSoup/blob/main/CKA.py)

The goal is scientific clarity: each article ties equations, algorithmic design, and code-level behavior together.

## What You Will Find

- A mathematical walk-through of layer-wise MonoSoup updates.
- A deep dive into block-wise linear CKA for representation analysis.
- A reproducible workflow guide for running and exporting experiments.
